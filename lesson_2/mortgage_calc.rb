# Lesson 2: Small Programs > 16. Assignment: Mortgage/Car Loan Calculator
=begin
  Take everything you've learned so far and build a mortgage calculator.
  You'll need three pieces of information:
    - the loan amount
    - the annual percentage rate (APR)
    - the loan duration

  From the above you'll need to calculate the following things:
    - monthly interest rate  
    - loan duration in months
    - monthly payment

    Formula:
    # m = p * (j / (1 - (1 + j)**(-n)))

    m = monthly payment
    p = loan amount
    j = monthly interest rate
    n = loan duration in months

  When you write the program don't use single letter variables. Be explicit.
  
  Don't forget to run through Rubocop.
